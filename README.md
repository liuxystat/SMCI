The main programs are in the file "SMCI.S" and  "SMCI.K", which can produce the estimated covariate effects in terms of point estimates, standard errors, and p-values, as well as the estimated survival functions using  SMCI-K or SMCI-S approach.

Some necessary functions are given in other files.

One needs to put those files in the working directory before running the main program.
